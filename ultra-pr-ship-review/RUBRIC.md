# Ultra PR Ship Review — Rubric Reference

Companion to `SKILL.md`. Operational protocol stays in the skill file.

**Scoring:** 0 = fail · 1 = partial · 2 = pass

**Targets:**
- **Fast path (most PRs):** 10 gates × 2 pts = 20 → **≥17 (85%)** for SHIP candidate
- **Full ledger:** 48 items × 2 pts = 96 → **≥82 (85%)** for complex PRs

## Fast-path gate scorecard (20 pts)

| ID | Gate | 2 = Pass |
|----|------|----------|
| G1 | verify | `npm run verify` (or STACK.md equivalent) exit 0 with evidence pasted |
| G2 | migrations | New `00NN_*.sql` + schema file sync; no edited applied migrations |
| G3 | tests | Logic changes have regression or route tests |
| G4 | api-auth | cron/dashboard/v1 patterns match PATHS.md |
| G5 | plan-gates | `requireEntitlement` + entitlement UI gate where tiered |
| G6 | boundaries | no lib → components; no dev SDK in app bundle |
| G7 | secrets | no real keys/secrets in diff |
| G8 | scope | no drive-by refactors |
| G9 | booking | slot holds, idempotency, timezone if booking touched |
| G10 | deploy | new env/cron documented if applicable |

**Ship candidate:** ≥17/20 with zero severity-overlay failures.
